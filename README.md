# Hi there, I'm `Nicolas Makiniks`!

> 🖥️ I'm starting in the world of codes and trying to self learn while making my hobbies like coding, gaming and reviewing some work of people (nothing special).

> 🌱 Currently I'm starting in a new faculty of programming and thinking to make some games while I can get some job like programmer, data analyses or like.

I'll list my progress here while working in my evolution of my learn and codes and scripts, starting with the basics:
<!-- Some day my profile will see like this one [Dalpat Rathore](https://github.com/DalpatRathore) -->
- [Introduction to GitHub](https://github.com/Nicolas-Makiniks/Introduction-to-GitHub) is my first project to learn how to use Git.
